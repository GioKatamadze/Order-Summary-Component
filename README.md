## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on background styles, hover effects and copying desired design.

## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background image and give gradient effect
3. Create card wrapper div
4. Add images and text
5. Give images sizes and styles in CSS
6. Give texts and icons font styles in CSS
7. Create hover effects for buttons and links

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using CSS for interesting background of a page, the main challenge that I overcame was to create gradient type of effect, with wavy line. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the CSS code, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master CSS to make more dynamic and interactive projects
